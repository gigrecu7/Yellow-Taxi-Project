# Yellow-Taxi-Project
This assignment included working with trip record data from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. The data included features such as pickup and drop-off times, pickup and drop-off neighborhoods, trip duration, distance, total fare, and tip amounts for every taxi ride during a one-month period in New York City. The three questions needed to be answered: 

  1. What one-hour window in January 2020 (e.g. 3-4AM on January 22) saw the highest number of taxi pickups?

  2. According to www.nyc.gov ,the meter(f are_amount )is calculated using a$2.50 base fare  plus $0.50 per 1/5 mile when traveling above 12mph  or      per 60 seconds in slow traffic or when the vehicle is stopped. Use this information to build a model that predicts  fare_amount as a function        of trip duration, distance, and any other features you feel are appropriate. Were you able to successfully reverse engineer the fare rules?

  3. Construct a probabilistic model to predict the drop-off borough given relevant input features from the data. Using this model, what is your 
     estimate of the probability that a passenger is dropped off in Queens given she's picked up in Manhattan at 10:12 AM on a Tuesday? 
     
Through machine learning, data visualization, and problem-driven quantitative reasoning in R, the three questions were answered.
